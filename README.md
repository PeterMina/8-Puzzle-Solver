# 8-Puzzle-Solver
Overview
This project implements an agent to solve the 8-puzzle game using various search algorithms - Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* algorithm with Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics.

Application
Algorithms
Implemented algorithms:

BFS: Breadth-First Search
DFS: Depth-First Search
A*: A* Algorithm with Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics
Heuristics
Manhattan Distance: Sum of absolute differences in x and y coordinates between the current cell and the goal cell.
Euclidean Distance: Euclidean distance between the current cell and the goal cell.
